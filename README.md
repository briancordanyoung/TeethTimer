Gavin's Teeth Timer
-------------------
This little app is a hobby project to join the many other timers on the app store that help kids brush their teeth well.   This design will allow parents to add time to the timer by rotating the image wheel back a previous position, setting the timer length in the settings, and ultimately a fun polished look.

The app is written in Swift and has been a opportunity to try alternate design patterns, replacing delegate protocols with direct callback functions, nested enums and structs, and other language features.  All views are laid out with autolayout and will run on iOS 7 and up.
